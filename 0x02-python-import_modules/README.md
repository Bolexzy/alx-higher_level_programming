# Import & modules

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at Alx Africa. It aims to develop knowledge on how to import functions, how to create modules and how to use command line arguments in Python.

## Technologies

- Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
- Python Scripts are written with Python `3.8.1`
- C files are compiled using gcc `9.4.01`
- C files are written according to the C90 standard
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

Filename | Description
--- | ---
`0-add.py` | Imports a function from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result
`1-calculation.py` | Imports maths functions from a file and prints the result
`2-args.py` | Prints the number of and the list of its arguments
`4-hidden_discovery.py`	| Prints all the names defined by a compiled module
`5-variable_load.py` | Imports a variable from a file and prints its value
`100-my_calculator.py` | Imports all functions from a file and handles basics operations
`101-easy_print.py` | Prints `#pythoniscool`, followed by a new line
`102-magic_calculation.py` | Function that does exactly the same as a given Python bytecode
`102-magic_calculation.py` | Function that does exactly the same as a given Python bytecode
