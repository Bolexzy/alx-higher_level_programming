# More Classes and Objects

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Alx Africa**. It aims to learn about object oriented programming (OOP), Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, instances and classes attributes in **Python**.

## Technologies
- Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
- Python Scripts are written with Python 3.8.1
- C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.01
- C files are written according to the C90 standard
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
